# KP Test App

By Kaival Patel

## Getting Started

Due to Time Constraints didnt implemented nested tables or more than one tables, surely I could have done that with linking foreign keys. This app is developed in Flutter 3.3.3

Implemented with SQFlite (Due to time constraints but made sure whatever given is working completely fine). Thanks for giving your time.
